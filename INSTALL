The following dependencies are needed:

    dbus
    libxinerama
    libxft
    libxss
    libxdg-basedir
    glib
    pango/cairo

On Debian and Debian-based distros you'll probably also need the *-dev packages.

With all dependencies present you can build dunst with:

    $ make

If you're getting compilation errors after an update try compiling
with the default config.h.
If you didn't edit your config.h you can just delete it.

and install with:

    $ sudo make PREFIX=/usr install

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dunst is a lightweight notification-daemon for the libnotify. dunst
displays messages received via dbus or as commandline argument in a
fashion similar to dmenu.

but the height is given ("-geometry x2"), the message window
expands over  the  whole  screen (dmenu-like).
If  width  is  0,  the  window  expands  to  the longest
message displayed. A positive x is measured from the left,
a negative from the right side of the screen.

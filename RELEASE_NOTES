Release Notes For v1.3.0
===================================================================================

Version 1.3 is supposed to be fully backwards compatible with 1.2.

For users:

* Behavioral changes

  Dunst respects the timeout in milliseconds now. Notifications with a one second
  timeout are not shown up to three seconds.

  Transient notifications are now timing out properly also when in idle and are not
  saved in history.

  A prefixed tilde to path option (browser, dmenu, script) is interpreted as the
  home folder of the user.

* Configuration Options

  `icon_folders` got deprecated and renamed to `icon_path`. `icon_folders` is still
  supported, but will get removed in future.

  The option `ellpsize` got introduced. It controls where to ellipsize the text of
  an overlong notification if `word_wrap = no`.

  For transient notifications, there are the rules `set_transient` and
  `match_transient` to configure the behavior of the notification.

For maintainers:

* Dependencies

  The GTK3+ dependency got removed. Instead of this, gdk-pixbuf is required
  explicitly. This had been a transient dependency before.

  In the Makefile, libxrandr is now specified to require its version minimum to 1.5.
  The dependency on libxrandr >= 1.5 is not new. Dunst 1.2.0 required it too, but
  there was no active check for it.

* Portability

  GNU-specific functions have been disabled to make dunst portable to nongnu libc's.


For more details, consider [CHANGELOG.md].


===================================================================================
Release Notes For v1.2.0
===================================================================================

After about 3 years of inactivity, dunst is back under active development.

Version 1.2 is supposed to be fully backwards compatible with 1.1 but due to
the number of changes and the time since the last release there may be some
overlooked breakages. If one is found it should be reported to the bug tracker.

For users:

* Markup
    The `allow_markup` setting has been deprecated in favour of `markup` which
    is a multi-value setting that can be used to control much more accurately
    how markup in notifications should be handled. Currently it only supports
    `no`, `strip` and `full` as values but it is planned to be expanded soon.

    To preserve backwards compatibility, `allow_markup` is still supported but
    users are encouraged to update their configuration files since it will be
    removed after a few major releases.

* DPI handling
    The DPI value used is now retrieved from the `Xft.dpi` X resource if
    available. If not, the default value 96 will be used.

    Additionally, as an experiment a per-monitor dpi setting, which tries to
    calculate an acceptable dpi values for each monitor, has been added to the
    experimental section of the configuration file.

* RandR and Xinerama
    Dunst switched from using the Xinerama extension to provide multi-monitor
    support to using the more modern RandR extension. While this change won't
    affect the majority of users, some legacy drivers do not support RandR. In
    that case, the `force_xinerama` option was added as a way to fall back to
    the old method.

    The downside of forcing Xinerama to be used is that dunst won't be able to
    detect when a monitor is added or removed meaning that follow mode might
    break if the screen layout changes.

* Frame settings
    All the settings in the frame section of the configuration file have been
    deprecated and have been moved into the global section. The `color` and `size`
    settings became `frame_color` and `frame_size` respectively. As with
    `allow_markup`, the old format still works but it'll be removed in one of the
    next major releases.

* Deprecation of urgency-specific command line flags
    The urgency specific command line flags (`-li, -ni, -ci, -lf, -nf, -cf, -lb,
    -nb, -cb, -lfr, -nfr, -cfr, -lto, -nto, -cto`) have been deprecated with no
    plan for a replacement. If you rely on them please respond to issue #328 on
    the bug tracker with your use case.

For maintainers:

* The project homepage has been changed to https://dunst-project.org
* The main repository has been changed to https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst

* Dependency changes:
 - Dependency on libraries that were unused in the code but were mentioned as
   dependencies has been dropped. Dunst no longer depends on: libfreetype,
   libxft and libxext.
 - Added dependency on libxradnr and libgtk2.0.

For a full list of changes see CHANGELOG.md.

Release Notes For v1.0.0
===================================================================================

PACKAGE MAINTAINERS:
    There are new dependencies introduced with this version:
        *glib
        *pango/cairo

* The drawing backend was moved from Xlib to Cairo/Pango.
    This change requires some user intervention since Pango
    uses different font strings. For example "Monospace-12"
    becomes "Monospace 12". Font sizes might also get interpreted
    differently.

* Markup
    Markup within the notification can be interpreted by pango.
    Examples are <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b>. If the Markup
    can't be parsed by pango, the tags are stripped from the
    notification and the text is displayed as plain text. An error
    message gets printed to stdout describing why the markup could
    not be parsed.

    To make use of markup the option allow_markup must be set in dunstrc.
    If this option is not set, dunst falls back to the old behaviour
    (stripping all tags from the text and display plain text).

* Actions are now supported.
    If a client adds an action to a notification this gets indicated
    by an (A) infront of the notification. In this case the
    context menu shortcut can be used to invoke this action.

* Indicator for URLs.
    If dunst detects an URL within the notification this gets indicated
    by an (U) infront of the notification. As with actions the URL can
    be opened with the context menu shortcut. (This requires the browser
    option to be set in the dunstrc).

* dunstify ( a drop-in replacement for notify-send)
    Since notify-send lacks some features I need to for testing, I've
    written dunstify. It supports the same option as notify-send + The
    abillity to print the id of the notification to stdout and to replace
    or close existing notifications.

    example:
   id=$(dunstify -p "Replace" "this should get replaced after the sleep")
    sleep 5
    dunstify -r $id "replacement"

    see dunstify --help for additional info.

    Since dunstify depends on non-public parts of libnotify it may break
    on every other libnotify version than that version that I use.
    Because of this it does not get build and installed by default.
    It can be build with "make dunstify". An installation target does
    not exist.

    Please don't open bug reports when dunstify doesn't work with your
    version of libnotify

===================================================================================
Release Notes For v0.4.0
===================================================================================

Since dunst has lost its ability to show notifications independend of
dbus/libnotify a long time ago I think it is time that the describtion reflects
that. Even though this breaks the acronym. So if you're a packager please update
the package description to read something like:

short:
"Dunst - a dmenu-ish notification-daemon"

long:
"Dunst is a highly configurable and lightweight notification-daemon"

Release Tarballs are now available at:
http://www.knopwob.org/public/dunst-release/

For more information have a look at the CHANGELOG and the new options in dunstrc.

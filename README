NAME
       dunst - dmenu-ish universal notification system

SYNOPSIS
       dunst [-geometry geom] [-fn font] [-nb color] [-nf color] [-to secs] [-key key] [-mod modifier] [-mon n]

DESCRIPTION
       dunst is a lightweight notification-daemon for the libnotify. It can also be used as a standalone notification system. Dnotify displays messages received via dbus or as commandline argu‐
       ment in a fashion similar to dmenu and additionally prints them to stdout. Notifications can be closed via mouseclick.

OPTIONS
       -h/--help
              display help message.

       -fn/ font
              defines the font or font set used.

       -nb/-bg color
              defines the background color. #RGB, #RRGGBB and X color names are supported.

       -nf/-fg color
              defines the background color.

       -msg msg
              display msg instead of listening to notifications. This option can be used multiple times.

       -to secs
              display each message for secs seconds.

       -key key
              close window by pressing key [a,b,space,Return etc.] (should be used in combination with -mod).

       -mod modifier
              defines the modifier for the key. Available modifiers are: ctrl,shift,mod1 (usually the alt-key),mod2,mod3,mod4 (usually windows key). This option can be used  multiple  times  to
              combine modifiers.

       -mon n show the notification on monitor n.

       -mon [[<width>]x<height>][+/-<X>+/-<y>]
              The geometry of the message window. The height is measured in lines everything else in pixels. If the width is omitted but the height is given ("-geometry x2"), the message window
              expands over the whole screen (dmenu-like). If width is 0, the window expands to the longest message displayed. A positive x is measured from the left, a negative from  the  right
              side of the screen. Y is measured from the top and down respectevly. see also EXAMPLES show the notification on monitor n.


EXAMPLES
       dunst -geometry x2 Displays a maximum of two lines across the top of the screen.

       dunst -geometry x3+0-0
              Displays a maximum of three the lines across the bottom of the screen.

       dunst -geometry 0x3-30+20
              Displays a maximum of three lines 30 pixels away from the right border and 20 pixels away from the top with adaptive size.

       dunst -geometry 100x3-30+20
              Displays a maximum of three lines 30 pixels away from the right border and 20 pixels away from the top with a width of 100 pixels.

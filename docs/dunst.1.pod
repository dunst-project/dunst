=head1 NAME

dunst - A customizable and lightweight notification-daemon

=head1 SYNOPSIS

dunst [-conf file] [-verbosity v] [-print] [--startup-notification]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dunst is a highly configurable and lightweight notification daemon.

=head2 Autostarting dunst

On most installations dunst should be able to automatically be started by D-Bus
when a notification is sent. This is not recommended when multiple notification
deamons are installed, because D-Bus will not know which one to start.
Other ways of autostarting dunst include starting dunst with your desktop
environment or window manager's autostart functionality or via the provided
systemd service.

=head1 COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-h/--help>

List all command line flags

=item B<-conf/-config file>

Use alternative config file.
This disables the search for other config files.
If it cannot be opened Dunst will issue a warning and fall back on its internal
defaults.
(Hint: `dunst -conf - </dev/null` can be used to enforce the defaults, i.e. for
testing)

=item B<-v/--version>

Print version information.

=item B<-verbosity> (values: 'crit', 'warn', 'mesg', 'info', 'debug' default 'mesg')

Do not display log messages, which have lower precedence than specified
verbosity. This won't affect printing notifications on the terminal. Use
the '-print' option for this.

=item B<-print>

Print notifications to stdout. This might be useful for logging, setting up
rules or using the output in other scripts.

=item B<--startup_notification> (values: [true/false], default: false)

Display a notification on startup.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

A default configuration file is included (usually ##SYSCONFDIR##/dunst/dunstrc)
and serves as the least important configuration file. Note: this was previously
/usr/share/dunst/dunstrc. You can edit this file to change the system-wide
defaults or copy it to a more important location to override its settings. See
the FILES section for more details on where dunst searches for its
configuration files and how settings get applied.

See dunst(5) for all possible settings.

=head2 NOTIFY-SEND

dunst is able to get different colors for a message via notify-send.
In order to do that you have to add a hint via the -h option.
The progress value can be set with a hint, too.

=over 4

=item notify-send -h string:fgcolor:#ff4444

=item notify-send -h string:bgcolor:#4444ff -h string:fgcolor:#ff4444 -h string:frcolor:#44ff44

=item notify-send -h int:value:42 "Working ..."

=back

=head1 MISCELLANEOUS

Dunst can be paused via the `dunstctl set-paused true` command. To unpause dunst use
`dunstctl set-paused false`.
Another way is to send SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 to pause and unpause
respectively. Pausing using dunstctl is recommended over using signals, because
the meaning of the signals is not be stable and might change in the future.

When paused dunst will not display any notifications but keep all notifications
in a queue.  This can for example be wrapped around a screen locker (i3lock,
slock) to prevent flickering of notifications through the lock and to read all
missed notifications after returning to the computer.

=head1 FILES

These are the base directories dunst searches for configuration files in
descending order of imortance:

=over 4

$XDG_CONFIG_HOME ($HOME/.config if unset or empty)

$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS (:-separated list of base directories in descending order
of importance; ##SYSCONFDIR## if unset or empty)

=back

Dunst will search these directories for the following relative path:

=over 4

dunst/dunstrc

=back

All settings from all files get applied. Settings in more important files
override those in less important ones. Settings not present in more imortant
files are taken from a less important one or from the internal defaults if they
are not found in any file.

=over 4

=item This is where the default (least important) config file is located:

##SYSCONFDIR##/dunst/dunstrc

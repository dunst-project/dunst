=item B<history-pop> [ID]

in dunst. You can optionally pass an ID to history-pop, in which case the
notification with the given ID will be shown.

=item B<is-paused>

Check if dunst is currently running or paused. If dunst is paused notifications
will be kept but not shown until it is unpaused.

=item B<set-paused> true/false/toggle

Set the paused status of dunst. If false, dunst is running normally, if true,
dunst is paused (with maximum pause level of 100). 
See the is-paused command and the dunst man page for more information.

=item B<get-pause-level>

This can be combined with notification's override_pause_level to selectively display specific notifications while paused.

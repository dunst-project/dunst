# Dunst changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- Added `ignore_close` rule option to prevent the requesting application from
  dismissing their notifications.
### Changed
### Fixed

## 1.7.3 -- 2021-12-08

### Added
### Changed
- `follow` is now `none` again by default. This was the case before v1.7.0 as well. (#990).

### Fixed
- `dunstctl action` is now working again.
- Segfault in experimental icon lookup when an inherited theme doesn't exist.
- `icon_position = off` not being respected (#996).

## 1.7.2 -- 2021-11-30

### Added
- Experimental recursive icon lookup. This is not enabled by default and can be
  enabled by setting `enable_recursive_icon_lookup=true`. Setting icon sizes
  still doesn't work entirely as it's supposed to and will be improved in future
  releases. (#965)
- You can now enable or disable rules on the fly with `dunstctl rule $name$
  enable/disable`. (#981)
- `dunstctl history` lists your notification history in JSON format for
  processing by scripts. (#970)
- You can now pop specific notifications from history by passing a notification
  ID to `dunstctl history-pop`. (#970)
- `default_icon` setting for setting the icon when no icons are given (#984)
- Implemented display size detection in Wayland. (#973)
### Changed
### Fixed
- Text being cut off on X11 when using fractional scaling. (#975)
- Incorrect hitbox for notification on X11 with scaling. (#980)
- Improved warning messages for deprecated sections. (#974)
- `icon` being interpreted as a filter and not being allowed in the special
  urgency sections. This is a compatibility fix, but it's recommended to replace
  all usages of `icon` in these sections with `default_icon` to prevent
  confusion with the `icon` rule in other sections. (#984)
- `new_icon` being used in the default dunstrc where `default_icon` is the
  intended settings. This was commented by default, so it doesn't affect any
  default behaviour. (#984)
- Notifications bleeding to other screens when the width was big enough. Now the
  notification's width is lowered when it would otherwise leave the display.


## 1.7.1 -- 2021-11-01

### Added
- Script environment variable `DUNST_DESKTOP_ENTRY`. (#874)
- Rule `set_category` for change a notifications category with rules. (1b72b2a)

- Outdated documentation. (#943, #944 and more)
- Empty strings not being allowed in settings. (#946)
- Dunst crashing when compositor doesn't support `zwlr_foreign_toplevel_v1`. (#948)
- Xmore notifications showing a progress bar and icon. (#915)
- Markup is now a rule again. Before this was undocumented behaviour. (#955)
- Double free when setting `XDG_CONFIG_DIR`. (#957)
- Dunst crashing on some compositors. (#948)
- Dunst not exiting when wayland compositor quits. (#961)
- Now the separators are not responsive to mouse clicks anymore. (#960)

## 1.7.0 -- 2021-10-19:

### Added
- `context` and `context_all` mouse actions for opening the context menu (#848)
- `open_url` mouse action for opening url's in a notification (#848)
- `action_name` rule for setting a default action to perform when using
  `do_action` (#848)
- HiDPI support for both Wayland and X11. On wayland the scale can be set from
  your compositor's settings and is automatically picked up by dunst. On X11
  dunst will guess the scale based on the DPI of the screen. If that isn't good,
  you can set the `scale` variable in the settings. (#854 and #890)
- `highlight` can now also be set through dbus hints with the key `hlcolor`
  (#862)
- Your dunstrc is now being checked by dunst. Dunst will print a warning when
  coming across an non-existing/invalid setting. (#803)
- Wayland fullscreen detection (#814)
- Wayland touch support (#814)
- Cursor is now being changed to `left_ptr` when hovering over dunst (Wayland)
  (#903)

### Changed
- `startup_notification` and `verbosity` are now only available as a command
  line arguments. (#803)
- Rule settings can now also be used in the `[global]` section. They will then
  apply to all the notifications. (#803)
- `fullscreen`, `ellpsize` and `word_wrap` are now rules. They can still be used
  in the `[global]` section as well (see above). (#937 and #803)
- The appid's now also need to match when stacking notifications. (#886)
- `xdg-open` is now being used by default for opening URL's. (#889)
- `geometry` and `notification_height` have been replaced by `origin`, `width`,
  `height`, `offset` and `notification_limit`. This allows for more flexible
  geometry settings. (#855)
- There were a bunch of changes in the installation and default locations. See
  the release notes for more information.
- Upon seeing invalid markup, dunst is a bit smarter in stripping the markup.

### Fixed
- Lots of debug messages when `idle_timeout=0` (#814)
- `follow=none` not working on Wayland (#814)
- Incorrect sorting when `sort` is false
- NULL pointer dereference on Wayland
- Dunst not redrawing after `close_all` action.
- Dunst not announcing icon-static capability over dbus (#867)
- Dunst not falling back to X11 output when it can't initialize the Wayland
  output. (#834)
- Improve stability on Wayland. (#930 and more)

### Removed
- The `[shortcuts]` section with all it's settings. Use your WM/DE's shortcut
  manager and `dunstctl` to replace it. (#803)
- Setting settings via command line arguments. (#803)
- Setting settings via `config.h`. (#803)
